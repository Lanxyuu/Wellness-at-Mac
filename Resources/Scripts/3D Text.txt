Good morning, [player].
I broke up with him yesterday.
I don’t think I’m going to go into detail about it, but I think I handled it pretty well.
It’s done and over with, and I feel like a burden has been lifted from my shoulders.
A part of me still misses him... but with every minute, I’m realizing more and more that I’m missing him less and less.
[player], thank you so much for everything you’ve done.
Thank you for being a part of my healthy living club, or else I would’ve never gotten to meet you.
    
END
