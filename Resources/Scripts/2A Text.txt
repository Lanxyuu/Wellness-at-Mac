(It’s a chilly Monday morning and I’m waiting for Sabrina, my friend whom I always walk to school with.)
(I watch as other student pass by me on the way to school in pairs and small groups.)
(Where is she? Sabrina being late isn’t a rare sight, but she’s usually never this late.)
. . . !
[player]! Sorry! I woke up late again!
It's fine. Today you were later than usual, though...
Ahaha... I had a lot of work last night...
(Sabrina laughs, but I can tell she's forcing it.)
(She has bags under her eyes and she looks noticeably more disheveled than usual.)
You've been late more than usual lately. Are you sure you're okay?
...Oh.
Yeah! Yeah! Of course.
(She's pretty distracted and out of it, too.)
(I refrain from asking her about it, though. She's my close friend.)
(If there's something bothering me, she'll tell me about it.)
(We walk in silence for a bit...)
(...)
Oh, [player], there's no Wellness meeting today, right?
Nope.
(Shouldn't she know that already...? She's the vice president, after all...)
Oh, okay.
...
[player], can you meet me in the clubroom after school today?
Sure! English Room, right?
Yeah. It's not for the club... but you'll still come, right? It's important to me.
Of course!
(I wonder what's up...)
(Sabrina usually loves going home as soon as possible after school.)
(Asking to meet like this definitely isn't like her.)
(Well, I guess I'll find out this afternoon.)
After school . . .
(I make my way to the room after school...)
(I wonder what Sabrina wants to talk to me about.)
Sabrina?
. . . !
Oh, you're here too?
. . . !
It seems like we've all been told to meet here by Sabrina. Do you know why?
Nope. I wonder if Monica was told to meet here too.
She was, but she had something with her boyfriend today.
I see...
. . .
Hi guys.
Hi, Sabrina. What's up?
Sorry for calling everyone here today.
You're all my close friends, so I want to tell you something.
Yeah, anything!
The thing is... I've been dealing with a lot of stress lately, and I'm not sure if I can handle it.
Do you know why you're feeling stressed?
I think it's because of school.
I just have so many assignments and projects, and it's getting hard for me to keep track of them.
I feel kind of overwhelmed, to be honest.
On top of that, I'm in a lot of clubs.
Besides our Wellness Club, I'm the vice-president of the Literature Club.
I'm also an exec of the Business Club and Science Club.
...I guess I'm just having trouble keeping my life together with all the activities I have.
Maybe you should take a break from your clubs.
Just for a week, to get your schoolwork done.
I don't want to though!
I'm the one who applied to these club positions, so I should be responsible for them.
But it won't hurt to take a break once in a while...
Especially if it's for your own wellbeing!
...
I guess...
(She doesn't look convinced...)
Well, anyway, that's all I wanted to tell you guys.
I just felt like getting it out of my system, you know?
Let's go now! Thanks for coming.
On the way home . . .
(On the way home, Sabrina doesn't say anything.)
(She doesn't really look happier than this morning, even though she told us about her problems...)
Sabrina, are you sure you don't want to take a break from your clubs?
Yeah. It's my responsibility. I can handle this.
You can't do it by compromising your health!
It's fine!
Really. I can do this.
. . .
Oh!
Looks like we're at my house. See you tomorrow, [player]!
(I have to try harder to convince her!)
Sabrina, wait!
Huh?
Let's eat breakfast at Amber Cafe tomorrow!
Tomorrow...?
Yeah! It's a PA Day tomorrow anyway, isn't it?
...
Okay.
Yay! Let's meet at the cafe at 8:30 tomorrow then?
Sure.
Bye.
Bye, Sabrina!
The next day. . .
(The next day, I'm at the cafe, waiting for Sabrina.)
(I really hope I'll be able to convince her to take a break...)
(If she doesn't, then I'll actually be concerned for her health, both physicall and mentally...)
Oh! Sabrina! Hi!
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?
Not at all!
Let's order!
(It doesn’t take too long for our food to come.)
(I begin eating my food. Sabrina, on the other hand, is idly picking at it with her fork.)
Anyways... Sabrina, I kind of wanted to talk to you.
About what...?
It's about your clubs...
(What should I say...?)
But it’s still my responsibility to handle.
I think you’re getting too involved in my issues.
(What should I say...?)
I never really asked for your help, though...
(What should I say...?)
...
I guess you're right... I'll try taking a break for a few days.
(What should I say...?)
-
(I'm glad that I managed to convince Sabrina to take a break from her clubs.)
(She seemed pretty adamant about handling it all by herself.)
But... [player], I don't think just taking a break is going to help me, though...
What do you mean?
Well, I also have a lot of trouble being organized with my work.
Like, keeping track of due dates and stuff...
Oh. Hmm... I don't really know how to deal with that.
I'll tell you if I think of anything though!
Okay.
(I think I'll ask Yulia and Natalie for some advice tomorrow.)
(They're really helpful with suggestions.)
The next morning. . .
(I'm in the classroom, waiting for Yulia and Natalie.)
...Oh!
What's up?
. . .
Hi, [player]. What did you want to talk about?
Hi, Natalie and Yulia!
I talked to Sabrina yesterday, and she agreed to take a break from her clubs!
That's great!
Yeah.
Except, besides her clubs, she also struggles with keeping track of assignments and due dates.
Do you have any suggestions on how to help her?
I use a planner to keep track of all my assignments.
It's simple but actually works very well.
I use a planner too! 
And I also use an app on my phone to plan out the day.
I see... Where can you buy a planner?
Indigo's a nice store. Their planners are both pretty and effective.
Okay! Thanks guys!
No problem.
Good luck!
On the way home. . .
(School passed by in the blink of an eye.)
(Literally... everything went black, and then suddenly school was over and I'm now on the way home.)
(Strange... whatever.)
(Anyways, now I'm with Sabrina.)
Sabrina, do you use a planner?
A planner? For what?
To keep track of your due dates and assignments, of course.
Not really... but do I have to? 
(What should I say...?)
It sounds like a lot of work.
(What should I say...?)
Well, I guess it's always worth a try.
(It seems like Sabrina’s pretty stubborn about not changing her habits.)
(I’m glad that she’s at least listening to advice now, though.)
Let’s go to the Indigo at the nearby mall then!
(At Indigo. . .)
(I watch as Sabrina buys the planner and puts it into her bag.)
Make sure you use it, okay?
Yeah, of course!
Oh, and...
[player], is it okay if we meet after school again tomorrow?
I want to tell you something.
Yeah, sure!
Thanks! Then I guess I'll be going home now!
Yup! See you tomorrow!
(As I watch Sabrina walk away, I wonder what she wants to talk to me about.)
(She’s taking a break from her clubs and becoming more organized.)
(What else could be bothering her?)
The next day. . .
. . .!
You're here, too?
Hi, [player].
Oh, hi, Natalie and Yulia. Did Sabrina ask for you guys to come?
Yup.
Monica was invited, but it seems like she's still busy with something related to her boyfriend...
I see.
(Should I be worried...? I haven’t really spoken with her for the past few days, either.)
(Well, I guess I should focus on Sabrina first.)
. . .
Thanks for coming, everyone!
No problem. Is everything okay?
Yeah!
The planner that [player] suggested I use is actually really helpful!
I’ve also been feeling better lately without the stress of my clubs.
I'm so happy to hear that! What did you want to talk to us about, then?
I just...
I just felt like all I’ve been doing is work recently.
I don’t feel too stressed anymore, but I feel a bit lonely. 
If that makes sense?
Yeah! That’s totally understandable.
You guys don’t really have to do anything this time! You’ve already helped me enough.
I just wanted to tell someone about my feelings...
Yeah, don’t worry about it! Feel free to tell us anything.
Thanks, guys! 
Well, class is starting soon, so I guess I’ll be leaving now. 
Bye!
(We watch as Sabrina leaves the room...)
What should we do?
I’m thinking we should make a plan for an outing or something.
Like, just like a hangout to let her relax and enjoy herself?
Yup.
[player], what do you think?
Hmm...
(It’s not good that Sabrina’s feeling lonely, but...)
(Shouldn’t she be focusing on getting her work done, since she’s so busy?)
(What should I do...?)
Yeah, I think planning an outing would be a good idea!
That’s good. I already have an idea in mind.
We can go to the board game cafe, eat dinner out, and then go stargazing!
That sounds really fun!
That’ll be sure to cheer her up!
Yeah. Thanks, Yulia!
No problem.
On the way home. . .
(Wow. School is over already?)
(Anyways...)
Sabrina, how do you feel about an outing tomorrow with me, Yulia, and Natalie?
What? Really??
Yeah! Let’s meet up tomorrow after school!
Wow...
I'm so happy that you guys are doing all this for me...
Don't worry about it! We're all going to have fun, and that's what matters.
Okay!
The next day...
(The next day, Sabrina, Yulia, Natalie, and I have a blast.)
(We had lots of fun at the board game cafe, and our dinner was delicious.)
The stars are so pretty!
I know, right?
I chose tonight for our outing because the reports say that we’d be having a clear night sky tonight!
Great going, Yulia!
(...)
...[player]?
Yeah?
Thank you so much for helping me. 
I’m so happy that I have such good friends who can support me like this.
No problem! No need to thank us.
For now, let's just enjoy the night!
Yeah!
. . .
