. . .
Actually... what you're saying...
I really don't feel comfortable doing that.
What do you mean?
[player], that doesn't sound very safe. 
I just want my breakup to be quick, done, and over with... without any extra, unneeded contact or drama...
(I thought I was telling her how to get her breakup done and over with...)
Monica...
Actually... [player], I don't think I have the courage to do this anymore. At least not with you.
Monica, hear me out...
I just realized that I'm too scared to break up, so I think I'll wait and hope that he breaks up with me.
Wait-
(I try to say more as Monica stands up and gets her stuff, but she doesn't seem to be listening.)
I think I should get to class now. See you, [player].
(...)
(Monica doesn't show up to class now, anymore. We haven't even seen her at school, since.)
(She doesn't hang out with us anymore. In fact, we tried texting her, but she never reads them, let alone replies.)
(It's like she completely dropped out of our lives...)
