I don’t think it’s a really good idea for her to do this, especially since she has so much work to do.
Well...
I guess so...
I hope Sabrina feels better soon, then.
Me too.
On the way home. . .
(Sabrina and I are walking home together like usual.)
(She’s staring at the ground as she walks beside me, and isn’t saying a word.)
Sabrina, are you feeling okay? You’ve been pretty quiet.
Oh, yeah... 
I guess I just feel kind of down.
Wait, really...?
Yeah...
I guess I still kind of wanted to do something with you guys.
Like... go hang out?
Yeah...
I-It's fine, though!
I guess I’ll just do more work for the next few days.
Oh... 
Okay...
(Oh no... I was the one who shut down the idea of planning an outing...)
(Well, Sabrina’s feeling better than before, so I guess things could’ve turned out worse...)
(She looked pretty gloomy for the next few weeks though...)
