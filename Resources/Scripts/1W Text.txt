The next day...
(I make my way to the classroom with a list of the recipes and tips I got.)
Hi!
Hi, Phil!
I found some recipes you can use for breakfast. They're healthy AND fast!
Wow, thanks!
No problem! I also found some morning tips that you can use to wake up without feeling too tired.
(Suddenly, Monica steps into the room.)
Hi, [player] and Phil! I'm just here to check things out. How's everything so far?
Great! I learned so much from [player]. 
Here, look at the recipe and tips I got!
...
(Monica begins reading the recipes and tips, her expression unreadable...)
...
Wow! This is actually really well-done!
Thanks!
Yeah! I’m really excited to try out these new recipes and tips! 
Thank you so much!
(Phil leaves the room, happily reading over his new recipes and tips.)
I wasn’t really sure if you were going to be able to this, especially at such a short notice.
I underestimated you! You did amazing!
Thank you! I also need to thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this. 
I learned a lot along the way, too.
That’s good.
. . . !
Oh, [player]! There you are! I was waiting for you! Let's go home already!!!
Okay! Bye Monica!
Bye!
On the way home. . .
Hey, [player]? 
Yeah?
Sorry for not being able to help you come up with ideas to help Phil yesterday... I had a lot of homework.
Don’t worry about it! It felt nice being able to help out and contribute to the club.
That’s good! I’m really glad you joined.
Me too! I’ll have to thank you for introducing it to me, though.
No problem!
(I wasn’t too sure about joining the club at first, but it was definitely the right decision.)
(Now that I’m officially an exec, I’m looking forward to whatever comes next for our Wellness Club!)
