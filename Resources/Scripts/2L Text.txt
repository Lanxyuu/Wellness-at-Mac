[player], I really feel like you're getting to involved with my problems...
I appreciate the fact that you're trying to help me, but I feel like I'm been forced into all this.
What do you mean?
Like, taking a break from my clubs, and using a planner...
But--
Can you stop trying to help me, please?

(I really though I was helping her, but...)
Okay, if that's what you really want...
Thanks...

(I didn't talk to Sabrina again for the rest of the week.)
(She stopped hanging out with her friends due to her clubs and homework.)
