I actually am really worried about you. Sabrina told me you didn’t say hi to her, and Yulia said that you were texting on your phone all day. 
I think that you should tell me, since I’m a trustworthy friend, and you should always talk to someone about your issues. Don't your friends deserve to know?
No, no, Monica! He’s an awful, obsessive boyfriend who tries to control your life! You'd be stupid not to dump him already.
No, he is crazy! You need to listen to me, your friend, and leave him ASAP.
So just say no. One word isn't that hard to say. Don't be a wimp - just tell him what you want to tell him.
You have to dump your boyfriend. It's your fault that you're letting him manipulate you, objectify you, and treat you like a toy, instead of a real person with feelings.
He is manipulative, and he is an awful person. Why are you even still with him? Stop trying to justify his behaviour as love - it’s control.
You're letting him destroy you and your life slowly. And I don't understand why you can't say no, because you're letting him force you to do things you don't like.
