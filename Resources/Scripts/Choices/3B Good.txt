You don’t have to worry about that. I wanted to check in and see how you’re doing. If you don’t want to talk right now, that’s totally okay.
You shouldn’t be the only one who has to face your issues. I would rather spend my time helping out a close friend, instead of doing anything else.
Monica, chill. Could you please tell me why you believe he’s such a great guy?
Well, how do *you* feel whenever he tells you that he wants you to look a certain way?
Why does it feel hard to say no?
I’m really concerned about your relationship. Your boyfriend manipulates you, objectifies you, and treats you like a toy, instead of a real person with feelings. 
These are only my thoughts. But I think he’s a manipulative person, and though he may say that he loves you, I feel as if he’s trying to control you.
I see that he’s exploiting you and controlling your life very often. And there’s no shame in saying no, because nobody should be forced to do things they don't like.
