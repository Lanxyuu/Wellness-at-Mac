The next day...
(I make my way to the classroom with a list of the recipes and tips I got.)
Hi!
Hi, Phil!
I found some recipes you can use for breakfast. They're healthy AND fast!
Wow, thanks!
No problem! I also found some morning tips that you can use to wake up without feeling too tired! Here, look!
(Suddenly, Monica steps into the room.)
Hi, [player] and Phil! I'm just here to check things out. How's everything so far?
Great! I learned so much from [player]. 
Here, look at the recipe and tips I got!
...
(Monica begins reading the recipes and tips, her expression unreadable...)
...
Hmm... sorry, [player], but this isn't really well-done...
Wait... really?
-
Oh...
What do I do then?
Don't worry, Phil. I'll put together a new list by tomorrow!
Sure. Then let’s meet tomorrow after school again, I guess?
Yup
(Phil leaves, and a slightly awkward silence ensues. I’m so embarrassed...)
I’m so sorry...
Don't worry about it! It's your first time doing something like this, after all.
Yeah, but I still feel bad...
. . .!
Oh, [player]! There you are! I was waiting for you! Let's go home already!!!
Okay. Bye, Monica. Sorry, once again.
It's fine, don't feel bad. Bye!
On the way home. . .
Hey, [player]? 
Yeah?
Sorry for not being able to help you come up with ideas to help Phil yesterday... I had a lot of homework.
It's fine... I just wish I was smarter with my recipe and tip choices...
Aw, what happened?
The recipes and tips I chose were pretty unhealthy...
(Sigh...)
(I feel bad for Sabrina, since she was so happy when I said I’d join the club, but...)
Sabrina, I’m thinking of quitting the club.
What? 
But this is only your first time doing something like this! You’ll get other chances!
It’s fine! It’s not just because of that. 
I just don’t feel like this club is right for me.
Really...?
Yeah, I’m just not really good at helping people.
Your club has a really great goal, and I fully support the fact that you want to help students from our school! 
I’m just not suitable for the team.
Well, if that’s what you really think...
Sorry for letting you down like this.
I promise to attend all your events, though!
I’ll continue to support you guys outside of the club.
Okay... 
Well, I can’t force you to do anything, but just make sure you don’t feel bad, okay?
Yeah! Thanks for inviting me to join the club anyway, because this was still a valuable learning experience for me!
No problem!
(I wasn’t too sure about joining the club at first, and I guess I was right.)
(I might not be a part of the team anymore, but I’m definitely going to keep on supporting the club.)
(Either way, I’m looking forward to whatever comes next for the Wellness Club!)
